# CrazySpin

This game is inspired by one of the first computer games that ever created - 
the original Pong game. However, we aim to make it more fun by adding spin
machenisms. There is a PvC and a PvP version.

This game requries `pygame` to run. You can easily install it with `pip`.

```
pip install pygame
```

This game is completed by Edward Ji in early 2018 with Michael Wang's help.

In 2021, we remade the game using the Unity game engine.
The game is now available [online](https://quarkgames.itch.io/crazy-spin-web) 
and as a [desktop app](https://quarkgames.itch.io/crazy-spin).
